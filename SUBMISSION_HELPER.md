    Velvet Posts Shield is a lightweight, PHP-only WordPress plugin designed to protect specific content from public view, making it accessible only to logged-in users. It offers a simple yet effective way to shield your posts, pages, or custom post types without relying on complex frameworks or external assets.

    **Key Features:**
    *   **Content Protection:** Restrict access to selected post types, displaying a custom message or redirecting non-logged-in users.
    *   **Selectable Post Types:** Choose exactly which public post types (e.g., Posts, Pages, custom post types) you want to shield from an intuitive multi-select dropdown.
    *   **Customizable Shield Message:** Define a personalized message to be shown to visitors who are not logged in, providing context about the restricted content.
    *   **Redirect to Login Option:** Instead of showing a message, automatically redirect non-logged-in users to the WordPress login page, bringing them back to the original content upon successful login.
    *   **Simplicity & Efficiency:** Built with a "PHP-only" philosophy, ensuring minimal impact on performance and ease of understanding. All styles for the admin page and frontend shield message are inline.
    *   **Admin Settings Page:** Easily configure all plugin options from a dedicated "Velvet Shield" settings page under the WordPress "Settings" menu.
    *   **Velvet Styling:** The admin interface and frontend shield message feature subtle, elegant styling to provide a consistent "velvet" feel.
