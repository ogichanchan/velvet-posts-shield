== Description ==
Velvet Posts Shield is a unique, lightweight, and PHP-only WordPress utility designed to elegantly protect your selected post types from unauthorized access by non-logged-in users. This plugin allows administrators to easily restrict content on posts, pages, or custom post types, acting as a "velvet" shield. You have the flexibility to either display a customizable message to visitors who are not logged in, or seamlessly redirect them to the WordPress login page to gain access. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, all administrative styles and frontend messages are handled inline, ensuring minimal impact on site performance and a streamlined user experience. It offers a straightforward solution for robust content access control without complex configurations.
